Robotics used in homes for domestic duties reduce human work. Use of AI-robots in medicine to perform surgery so provide more surgeons. Use of AI-robots in medicine to perform surgery can speed up surgery Use of AI-robots in caring for sick/elderly humans reduces the need for carers.   Disadvantages of AI in robotics:\n Artificial Intelligence (AI) in robotics enables intrusion into of workspace of humans. Robotics used in homes for domestic duties enquire power sources leading to increased costs. Robots used in homes for domestic duties may not be so thorough as humans. Robots have displaced humans from jobs. AI-robots consume more power than simple robots. AI needs to provide communication skills that humans can interact with. Some tasks are more acceptable if AI-robot is humanoid in shape. Development of rules/etiquette for AI-driven robots that is acceptable to humans. Requires AI and systems for understanding social cues from humans.
