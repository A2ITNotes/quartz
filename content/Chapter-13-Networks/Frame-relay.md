Frame Relay
- Layer 2 and 3/data link/network layer protocol  
- Puts data into variable-sized packets/frames  
- Does not include error-correction/error corrections is done by devices  
	- ...can be unreliable  
- Specifies physical and logical link layers  
- Used in packet switch
- Used on integrated services digital network (ISDN)  
- Used in permanent virtual circuits (PVC)  
- Can provide QoS  
	- ...worth constant bitrate/emulation of circuit switching
