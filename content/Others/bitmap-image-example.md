The image in Fig. 1 has been created/saved as a bitmap
Bitmaps are made of pixels
The image in Fig. 2 has been saved as a compressed image with too
much compression
Loss of pixel/data during compression so detail is lost in the image of the
face
The compression artefacts are visible to the human eye
The pixels in Fig. 2 are no longer small enough to be indistinguishable by
the human eye
When enlarged the pixels of the face/image become visible
The face now looks unrealistic/blocky so the features are not
distinguishable.
