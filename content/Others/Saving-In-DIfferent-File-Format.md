title: "Saving In DIfferent File Format "

Saving in different file formats 

- Some graphics software may not support all file types so different export options allows images to be shared e.g. use of JPEG / GIF is almost universal
- Images can be saved as compressed images  to save storage space allow use in various scenarios e.g. use of JPEG allows compression by various amounts but the more compression the lower the quality
- GIF allows areas to be made transparent whereas JPEG does not support this
- Different file types support different colour depths for use in various situations e.g. JPEG supports more colours than GIF
- Quality of the image is affected by choice of filetype e.g. TIFF retains betterquality than JPEG / GIF when compressed
- Bitmap (BMP) files restrict the use of the images to e.g. Windows OS so availability of other types allows cross-platform use.
