Advantages Of Fiber Optic:

- Can provide greater bandwidth to provide faster rate of data transfer
- Can carry thousands more connections c.f. electrical cable so not so many cables required
- Lower signal losses over distance so less need for amplifiers/repeaters so less maintenance
- Can span longer distances so is used to cross difficult areas
- No interaction with other cables as resistant to electrical interference
- ...can be used in areas of high electromagnetic activity
- No crosstalk with adjacent cables so no distortion of signals
- Lighter in weight so can be more suitable for use in aircraft
- No sparks produced if faulty/cut so safer in high risk areas
- Resistant to corrosion so less maintenance required
- Smaller cable size so can be used in confined spaces
- Difficult to ‘hack’/listen/tap into so more secure

Disadvantage of Fiver Optic

- Can't go around corners/bends unlike laser beams
- Can be more expensive to install than copper cables
- Specialist test equipment is needed
- Specialist tools are required for joining optical fibres
- Physical damage is more likely to interfere with signal transmission compared to similar with copper cables
- Wildlife prefer the covering of optic fibres for nesting materials compared to those around copper cables
- Underwater fibre optic cables are more susceptible to chemical damage than copper ones e.g. hydrogen will degrade them
- Cannot have 90° corners unlike copper cables.
