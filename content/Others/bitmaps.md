Bitmaps:

- Can be saved/stored in a variety of formats so that the webpage can be viewed on all computer platforms
- Can be output from many applications so easy to produce
- Can be created from the pixel arrays in memory
- Can display vast range of colours depending on bits per pixel
- Can display subtle gradations of colour as it is made of pixels
- Best for photo-realism compared to vector  images so images of advertised items appear more realistic
- Individual pixels can be modified to edit the image so images of advertised items are more appealing
- Can translate easily to dot-format output for use with CRTs/printers
