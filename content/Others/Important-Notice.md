==Memorize OSI Model==

- The syllabus shows a list of command words that are used in questions and the list explains what each wordrequires from candidates. It is very important that, when answering questions, candidates read the rubric and answer the questions in the appropriate manner.

- Some candidates created numbered bullet points for questions that required free responses. These answers rarely produce more than simple points or short statements with no descriptions, explanations or comparisons. 
- When answering questions that ask candidates to ‘explain’, ‘describe’, ‘evaluate’, ‘analyse’ or ‘discuss’ a topic, candidates should write in continuous prose so that they can expand and elaborate on their discussions.

- Few candidates omitted questions. Candidates are advised to attempt all questions. Most candidates who used additional pages properly cross-referenced these to their answers. This ensures that the full responses can be seen and marked by the examiners. Candidates who need additional space should always use clearly labelled additional pages and should not write on the margins or other blank spaces.
- Answers that candidates do not want to be marked should be clearly crossed though and a note added to indicate where the intended answer is written.
- Some good responses that displayed strong subject knowledge were seen. However, answers are expected to be in some detail at A Level and many responses lacked sufficient detail to gain credit. Some responses were also vague or generic, with knowledge not being applied to the contexts set in the questions. 
- It is vital that candidates read the information given in the short scenarios so that they can apply their knowledge when answering the subsequent questions. 
- Answering questions without referring to the scenario, or writing about a topic with little reference to the question as set, will not give access to the full range of available marks.
- Credit will not be given for repeating statements made in the questions.
