title: "Nodes In Vector Images "
--- 
What are nodes:

- Control point for paths in image
- Has defined positions on the x- and y- axes
- Determines direction of path
- Defines the start and end points of paths

---

Node editing:

- (Unrelated) nodes can be joined together
- Nodes can be moved to change the shape/path direction
- Add a new node(s) to change overall shape/add new path
- Delete a node to change overall shape/delete path
- Use of symmetrical nodes to create smooth, flowing curves on either side of a node.
- Use of asymmetrical nodes to obtain a different amount of curve on each side of the node (keeping a smooth flow through the node)
- Adjusting the length of each control arm without changing the direction
- Use of cusp nodes to create extreme changes in direction
- Adjusting the length and direction of each control arm independently
- Use of smooth nodes to create smooth transitions between straight/curved line segments
