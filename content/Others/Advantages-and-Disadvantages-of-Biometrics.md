- Biometric data is difficult/impossible to forge so is more secure
- More than one characteristic can be used to increase accuracy
- Staff always have biometric data with them/no forgetting passwords/ID cards

Disadvantages:
- Cost of/time taken for enrolment of staff can be high
- Biometric data can have a high false match rate leading to access by unauthorised persons
- Biometric data can have a high error rate leading to entry failures by staff/staff inconvenience/annoyance
- Authorised sharing of access using biometric data is difficult (unlike user IDs/passwords)
- Characteristics may alter over time so have to be retaken/staff re-enrolled at intervals
- Staff may object to having their biometric data stored/used
- Staff may be identified when they do not need to/should not be/e.g. facialrecognition in a crowd/rest area.
