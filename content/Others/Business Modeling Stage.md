## Business Modeling Stage
Defining the project in terms of what is to be developed
Gathering user requirements via [[focus groups]]/workshops
Defining data flow
Plan processes for managing project
e.g. Risk assessment/communication between development team/quality of
product
Planning tasks/activities. 

## Data Modelling/Requirements phase:
Review/analysis of data from business model/requirements phase
To create sets of data objects
Define relationship between data objects
Define test plans[[Importance of having a test plan]]
Define training strategies where required
Determine implementation methodology 
## Process Modelling/User Design phase:
Conversion of data objects from previous phase into detailed data flow
Define process for any changes/enhancements to data object sets
Define processes for adding/deleting/modifying a data object
Users interact with system analysts to develop models/early prototypes
## Application creation/construction phase:
Development/construction of prototype by expert programmers
Coding may be automated
Coding of components carried out simultaneously/in parallel
User evaluation of prototype
...repeatedly/iterative testing by users
...users suggest improvements/changes to prototype as it is developed
update/modification of prototype

## Implementation/testing/cutover phase:
Carrying out the test plan by testing the data flow
...testing interaction/interfaces between components
Testing the complete system
User training where required/writing training/help notes
Rollout of ‘app’ to users
