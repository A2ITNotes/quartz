Differences between tweeting and morphing:

- Morphing changes one object into a completely different object.
- Changes by morphing are smooth
- Morphing (often) overlays grid on image and uses it to remap new image over old, whereas tweening uses location points.
- Tweening changes animated objectâ€™s location/motion by creating intermediate frames.
- Tweening requires establishment of key frames.
- Tweening moves points of location of the object to new points whereas morphing does not (usually) do so.
