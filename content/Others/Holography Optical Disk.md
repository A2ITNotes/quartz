title: " Holography Optical Disk"
---
- Green and red lasers used
- Light from both is sent in parallel stream/collimated
- There is minimal divergence
- Output about 1 watt
- Green laser reads the data from top layer of disc
- Data stored as holographic laser interference patterns
- Red laser reads reference data stored on aluminium layer at/near bottom ofbdisc layers
- This is the servo information for accurately aligning the read head position over the disc
- A (dichroic) mirror allows the red laser light to pass while reflecting the green layer
- Stores c. 60 000 bits per pulse in densely packed tracks
- Compared to a single/one bit per pulse for current optical storage
- Can store 100 GB to 1 TB
- Phase storage systems can store more data.
