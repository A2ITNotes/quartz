Global Variable: 

- A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
- A variable declared outside a function
- A variable used throughout the script/program
- A value assigned to an undeclared variable.

Local Variables: 

- A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.
- Function parameters are always local to that function.
