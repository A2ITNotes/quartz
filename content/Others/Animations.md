Drawing In Twos

- Animator only needs to draw 12 frames instead of the full 24 so saves time 
- ... less computer time needed for the whole project
- (Drawing on ‘twos’) makes slow animations appear smoother to the eye
- Less precision  is needed than for drawing on ‘ones’ so drawing can be done faster
- (Drawing on ‘twos’) makes animations appear more lively  than when drawn on ‘ones’.
