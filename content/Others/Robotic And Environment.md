title: "Robotic And Environment "
--- 
Benefits of robotics on environment:
- More selective/accurate spraying of crops thus diminishing overspray of chemicals on crops
- Remote monitoring of global warming with use of independent robotic submarines carrying sensors into dangerous areas
- Autonomous gathering of data in dangerous areas to monitor environmental factors
- Use in food packaging by reduction in contamination of product as no human contact
- Use in industry to reduce environmental waste use...
	- ...e.g. solar panel cleaning robot uses less water than humans
	- ...less energy used in ‘dark’ factories where heating and lighting are not so important as few humans work in them
	- Leads to reduction in traffic so there is less pollution

Negative impacts of robotics on environment could include:

- ...increased use of power over manual labour
- ...increased use of scarce resources e.g. rare metals to manufacture robots
- ...environmental damage caused by extraction of rare metals.
