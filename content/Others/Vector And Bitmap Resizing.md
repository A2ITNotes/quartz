title: "Vector And Bitmap Resizing "
--- 
- Vector images use mathematical expressions of shapes to create images
- Shapes include lines/polygons/curves/ellipses
- Points defined with x-y axes and direction of path
- Shapes and positions are recalculated every time the image is resized so quality is retained
- Bitmap images consist of a set number of pixels
- When the bitmap is resized, pixels are the number of pixels changes so the quality is altered
- Lines in vector images do not get thinner/thicker proportionately when resized but those in bitmaps do so quality of bitmaps changes.
