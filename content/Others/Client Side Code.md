title: "Client Side Code"
--- 
The code is executed by the web browser
Not on the web server
Web browser may not support the code language
So the code may not execute properly/at all/produce errors
Different browsers run code in different ways
Developers must test all code with all browsers
Same browsers on different operating systems behave differently
Code may produce different results
Code requires high processing power
So webpages may display slowly/not at all
Non-functioning code may deter viewers leading to loss of audience/sales
via the website.
