--- 
Alpha testing is carried out by the developers whereas beta testing is carried
out by users
Alpha testing includes both black box testing and white box testing
Alpha Testing is carried out before the launch of software product into the
market
Beta testing is always a black box testing or a functional testing
Beta Testing is done at the time of software product marketing

Beta testing reduces product failure risks
Beta testing audiences give a more objective view than employees carrying
out alpha testing
Beta testing is carried out on a nearly complete system whereas alpha testing
will encounter far more bugs.
Alpha testers will provide a more technical analysis of the faults of the system


Alpha testing is carried out by employees of the developer whereas beta
testing is carried out by clients/end users/not employees
Alpha testing uses a lab/test environment whereas beta testing does not
require/use this/is in public
Alpha testing is carried out at developersâ€™ site whereas beta testing is
carried out at tester/end user location
Alpha testing does not involve reliability testing whereas beta testing does
Alpha testing does not involve security testing whereas beta testing does
Alpha testing involves both white and black box testing whereas beta testing
usually involves only black box testing
Critical issues can be fixed/addressed immediately during alpha testing
whereas beta testing produces feedback on issues for use at later date/in
later versions
Alpha testing ensures that the product is fit/ready for moving to beta testing
phase.
