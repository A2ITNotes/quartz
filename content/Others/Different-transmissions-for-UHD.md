Transmission For UHD
- Copper Cables:

  - Copper cable networks can provide bandwidth up to 100 Mbit/s 
  - Copper telephone cabling can provide ultra HD.
  - Distance from exchange is limited as bandwidth reduces over distance.

Transmission For UHD
- Fiber Optic
  - Fibre optic cables can provide high bandwidth (10 Gbit/s).
  - Cost of fibre to home to home is high.
  - Fibre to cabinet (FTC) may provide UHD to more homes.
  - Fibre allows much longer cable runs so may reduce installation costs over long distances from exchange to home.
