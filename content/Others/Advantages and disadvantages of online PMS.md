--- 
### Advantages:
Data is centralized on a company server/storage subsystem not on an
individual computer
Can be accessed on different devices so team members can work
remotely/on site/when mobile
Updates to project are shared (immediately) between users/Project Manager
and team
Status updates are immediate/notifications are immediate when project is
updated/altered/amended
Project members can collaborate in a project regardless of their physical
location
Communications and discussions can be in real-time regardless of location
Email notifications can be set up to occur automatically/integrated into the
software
Compatibility with other project management tools tends to be assured
Can control access to activities/parts of project using access lists/permission
rights
Backups can be automatically created at required/set intervals


### Disadvantages:
(Some) functionality may be missing/reduced compared to specialised
software e.g. resource levelling/Gantt chart creation
Internet connection is required so location may be limited
Requires compatible device/web browser/software
Security/privacy/data integrity issues may arise due to use of internet/public
telecommunications systems
May not be compatible with off-line software so projects may need
updating/modification when transferred
Use of internet may be a distraction to project team members.
