Video Bitrate:

- Bit rate represents the amount of information/data that is stored per unit time in the streamed/recorded video
- Bandwidth of available connections determines bit rate that can be used for the video
- If transmission medium does not have sufficient bandwidth to carry the required bit rate the video will stall/be jerky/impose constant buffering
	- ... and reduce the viewerâ€™s quality of experience of the video
- Video can be sampled at different bit rates/compressed to different bit rates
- Low bit rates produce video that lacks detail/is pixelated/shows motion in jerky steps
- The more bits that are used the higher the quality of the video e.g.
	- ... 16 kbit/s is suitable only for video phone applications as detail is lacking/any significant movement pixelates the image
	- ... 2.5 Mbit/s is suitable for low quality internet streaming
	- ... 9.6 Mbit/s is DVD quality
	- ... 8 to 15 Mbit/s is HD quality
	- ... 40 Mbit/s will allow 1080p/Blu-ray disc quality for the video.
