 Advantage of Robotics of delivery:

- Airborne drones do not need roads
- Airborne drones have direct routes to recipients
- Airborne drones do not need drivers
- Can provide â€˜last mileâ€™ delivery options
- Can provide assistance for elderly/disabled when collecting items e.g. prescriptions/groceries

Disadvantage of robot delivery:

- Use of robotic systems for room service in hotels may not be popular with guests due to use of cameras and recording systems
- Requirement for GPS and cameras to enable robotic delivery system to navigate and negotiate roads
- Require PIN code access to collect goods
- Airborne drones have limited carrying capacity
- Airborne drones have limited range
- Airborne drones are liable to interception with no immediate source of prevention by humans
- Airborne robot delivery system can cause disruption to aircraft
- Sidewalks are already overcrowded
- Sidewalks are subject to local laws restricting use by vehicles
- Urban robot delivery system may need special routes to be built
- Urban robot delivery systems travel at low speeds
- Urban robot delivery systems have difficulties avoiding objects
