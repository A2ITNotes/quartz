Phased Implementation of checkout system:
Advantages
- Changeover takes place in stages by replacing one part/area then another
- Parts of the old system are used alongside/with newly installed parts
- Costs of implementation can be spread over time as all hardware/software is not installed at once
- New systems can be used alongside old ones/form of parallel running with same stock control system to check functionality
- If (one/individual) new POS system does not work properly old ones can be used to avoid customer dissatisfaction at sales points
- Staff/user training can be carried out in stages by rotating staff around departments/areas
- â€¦with trained staff assisting those being trained
- Staff can be familiarised slowly/gradually with new system and see how it works while using old one

Disavn of Phased Implementation:
- If new POS system fails at checkout there is no backup available other than to move to an old POS system at another checkout with accompanying customer dissatisfaction
- Complete changeover of all POS systems will take much longer than e.g. direct changeover of all POS systems
- Disruption to checkouts will be longer than e.g. direct changeover of all POS systems.
