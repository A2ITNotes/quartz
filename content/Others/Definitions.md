- **bitmap graphics:**
Graphics that are defined by a matrix of pixels, each of which can be a different colour.
- **compression**:
The re-encoding of data into a format which uses fewer bits of information than the original. This can speed up loading and transferring the file, and reduce the amount of memory it takes up on your computer.
- **lossless compression**
Compression of a bitmap graphic which removes repeating patterns of data, but allows the original data to be exactly reconstructed from the compressed data.
- **lossy compression**
Compression of a bitmap graphic which uses approximations to remove and discard data within a graphic that is unlikely to be noticed.
- **meta-graphics**
Images containing a combination of bitmap and vector data.
- **node**
An editable point on a line or vector which can be selected, transformed and moved.
- **pixel**
Single unit / picture element of a bitmap graphic – a single coloured dot. Short for ‘picture element’.
- **pixellation**
When a bitmap image is enlarged so much that you can start to make out the individual pixels from which it is made. Edges and details lose their sharpness and the whole image can appear blurry or blocky.
- **rasterisation**
Conversion of a vector graphic to a bitmap graphic (at the native resolution of the display device) so that the vector can be viewed on a display.
- **resolution**
The amount of detail in an image, which is dependent on how many pixels it contains. Measured in Megapixels, dpi, ppi, or pixel dimensions.
- **resolution independent**
Graphics which are redrawn, when moved or scaled, at the native resolution of the display or output device (this applies to vector graphics).
- **run length encoding**
A data compression algorithm, that is supported by most bitmap file formats, which reduces the physical size of a file by encoding a run of repeating characters in the file into two bytes. The first byte is the run length - the number of repeating characters. The second byte is the repeating character or value. So the 5 byte run ‘AAAAA’ could be represented in two bytes as ‘5A’.
- **tracing**
Conversion of a bitmap graphic into a vector graphic.
- **vector graphics**
Graphics that are defined by mathematical descriptions of lines and shapes
