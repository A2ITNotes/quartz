Define Vector Images:

- Created using mathematical equations
- The mathematical formula construct lines and curves to create a shape
- The shape is redrawn using the formula when made larger or smaller
- Can use [layers-in-images](Others/layers-in-images.md)
- Vector images do not lose quality when made larger or smaller

Conversion to bitmap for viewing:

- Vector images are stored as geometric descriptions of shapes and colours
- Digital monitors cannot display co-ordinate-based graphics
- Because all digital monitors are pixel-based
- computer must convert the descriptions into pixels before sending to digital monitor...
- Uses an ADC-type action
- Resizes the image to suit the requirements of the monitor.
