- Costs of service provision may increase unexpectedly.
- Data travels over more networksâ€™ so is more easily compromised 
- Supplier of the storage may not be security aware to same degree as owner of the data
- Supplier of storage may go out of business 
- Performance of cloud storage may not be as good as that of local storage leading to increased access times
