Benefits of copper cable:

- Flexible so can be installed almost anywhere/can use ‘tight’ bends
- Can run electrical power along copper cable/Ethernet cable
- Can supply power to remote devices e.g. cameras high on buildings do not need separate power supply
- Costs of installation are less than for fibre optic cables
- NICs that use copper connections are cheaper to buy than those that use e.g. fibre optic
- Can provide higher bandwidths than wireless/WiFi
- Harder to hack into compared to WiFi

Drawbacks of copper cable:

- Can be subject to electrical interference
- Must not be run next to mains power cables
- Costs of installation are more than for wireless/WiFi
- Cannot provide as high bandwidths as fibre optic 
- Break/lose contact/connection more frequently than fibre optic cables
- Easier to connect into by unauthorised users
- More of a safety/tripping hazard than WiFi.
