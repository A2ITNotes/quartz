title: " Bitmap Vs Vector Images"
--- 
Bitmap vs vector:

- Photo-realism:
	-  bitmaps are comprised of small pixels so the bitmap is the most   suitable format for photorealistic images or images with high amounts of fine  detail
	- vector image, does not because it is comprised of larger objects and cannot achieve  fine detail 
  
- Scalability: 
	- vector images are mathematically defined objects so sizes can be easily manipulated  no loss in the quality of the image. 
	- vector image are rerendered at a greater or smaller scale to provide consistently smooth edges.
	-  changing the size of a bitmap requires a complete rearrangement of the pixels.
	-  An enlarged bitmap is likely to appear blurry, or “pixelated,” meaning that the different pixels of the image have become visible.  
  
- Shape:
	- a bitmap image always has four straight edges while vector images can be any shape.  
  
- File size: 
	- complex vector images can have a very large file size due to the   complex instructions needed to create them;
	-  the size of the file is not dependant on the size of the image:
	-  small complex images can have a large file size; 
	- bitmap images can be large but can be compressed.  
  
- Conversion between file types:
	- the most common file type for bitmap web images are jpeg or gif, and conversion to these is simple without loss of quality; 
	- conversion of vector images often results in more loss of quality.
