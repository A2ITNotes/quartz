title: "Configuring WAP for security "
--- 
Configuring WAP for security:

- Cloak the network so that it does not appear in the list of wireless networks
- Use of SSID hiding provides limited protection
- Filter MAC addresses to allow only those known/preconfigured to connect
- Ensure that the WAP is not issuing IP addresses to unknown devices
- Use encryption for the traffic between WAP and connected devices
- Use an (up-to-date) encryption protocol such Wi-Fi protected Access (WPA) and (later variants)
- Avoid using out-of-date protocols such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)/Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
- Require users to enter a ‘network key’/security key/passphrase when connecting
- Use a key that should be at least 14 characters long to make it ‘uncrackable’.
