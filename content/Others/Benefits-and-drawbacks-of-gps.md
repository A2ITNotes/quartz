## Benefits include:
- Access to satellite signals is available over most of surface of earth unlike signals from terrestrial transmitters
- Transmission of GPS signals is not dependent on political boundaries
- Satellite signals are accessible over oceans where terrestrial transmissions are difficult to receive due to the long distances from land
- Signals are available to anyone who wishes to use them (unless switched off by operator of satellite)
- Satellites are vandal-proof/ inaccessible to those who would physically attempt to disrupt their function

## Drawbacks include:
- Requires a large number (c.25 to 35) of satellites to be in orbit to provide adequate coverage of terrain
- Cannot easily be repaired if malfunctioning
- Requires at least 3, preferably 4, satellites to be visible to / received by GPS receiver to achieve reliable/accurate positioning
- Satellite signals are blocked by solid objects/buildings/in tunnels/trees/dense clouds/ snow storms so, in these circumstances, GPS receivers may«
- «fail to provide locations
- «may provide erroneous locations.
