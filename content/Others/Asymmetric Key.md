title: "ðŸ”‘Asymmetric Key "
--- 
Advantages of Asymmetric key:
-  uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt
- ...public key is known to all, but private key is known only to recipient
- ...only private key must be kept secret
- Â«anyone can use public key to encrypt
- ...only recipient can decrypt
- ...keys are not shared
- ...so is very secure
- ...if private key compromised, only senders data is at risk as any other data sent to others is encrypted with a different public key.


 Disadvantages of asymmetric key:

- ...process is relatively slow...
- ...so not suitable for e.g. hard disk encryption on-the-fly.
