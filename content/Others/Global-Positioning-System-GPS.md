GPS:
- Civilian signals from satellite travel by line of sight to navigation device  
- Use L1/1575.42 MHz in UHF band  
- Satellites are Low Earth Orbit/LEO  
- Signal contains ID code of the satellite  
- ...and status/health information  
- ...and current date and time from atomic clock in the satellite  
- ...and almanac data about where each GPS satellite is at any point in time  
- Navigation device must lock to (at least) 2 satellites to   calculate 2D position (i.e. latitude and longitude)  
  
- To 4 or more (usually 4 to 7) satellites to calculate 3D position   (i.e. latitude, longitude and altitude/elevation)  
  
- Using trilateration techniques  
  
- Calculation by finding intersect point by timing the signals from the satellites
