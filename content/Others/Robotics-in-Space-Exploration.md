Robotics In Space Exploration:

- Can be used to aid humans in space exploration
- Used for tasks (accept examples) in hazardous conditions e.g. extreme temperatures where humans cannot go
- autonomous spacecraft for space exploration at long distances
- autonomous spacecraft for delivery of resources to/return of materials from e.g. ISS
- autonomous machines for repair of space satellites
- Robotic arms fitted to space craft to move (large) objects
- autonomous vehicles for exploration of other space objects.
