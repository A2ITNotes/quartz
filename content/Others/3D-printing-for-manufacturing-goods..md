Advantages  of 3D printing for manufacturing:

- Easier to customise products such as pills to users specific   requirements
- Printing can be done remotely so no need to transport the final product from   factory to destination  
- prototypes can be produced more rapidly for testing so production is   speeded up  
- Manufacturing of product may be faster than traditional methods so product  is available sooner  
- Costs may be reduced due to less need for   specialist machinery  
- No need to store excess inventory
- Can produce items  in harsh environments where traditional  methods may not be possible

Disadvantages  of 3D printing in manufacturing:

- Limited materials available for printing so product range is restricted
- Copyright issues arise as easier for anyone to print the product  
- Dangerous items can be more easily created e.g. Knives/guns  
- Useless items produced and thrown away these have an environmental   impact  
- Limited size of products due to restrictions on size of printer  
- Printing can be quite slow compared to traditional manufacturing.
