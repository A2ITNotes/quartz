Drawbacks of white box testing:  

- Tester must have in-depth knowledge of system

	- ...cannot be sure that the testing is not causing the errors it flags up
	- ...cannot be sure that all platforms support the white box testing system
	-  changes to code of system may cause white box testing to fail
