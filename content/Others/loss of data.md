- Surge protectors to minimize the effect of power surges on computer   systems  
- Using uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and/or backup generator to protect   against a power failure  
- Use of fire prevention
- Use of anti-virus software to protect data against corruption
- Use of firewalls to prevent unauthorised access
