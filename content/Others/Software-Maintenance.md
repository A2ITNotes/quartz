Software Maintenance

- If it is error-free, corrective maintenance is not needed  
  
- If there are no new situations likely to arise, adaptive is not needed  
  
- Perfective maintenance is needed to modify the code  
	- ...enhance  the software capabilities to increase its   usefulness  
	- Delete unused functions to reduce the complexity
	- Optimise the code to increase functional speed

Corrective Maintenance:
	- To (detect and) correct errors in the program code so that the system works properly 
- Adaptive Maintenance
	-  To modify the system so that it remains compatible with any changes to the technical environment
	- preventative maintenance
	- To help prevent problems caused by upcoming vulnerabilities in the system
	- To ensure that the system continues to work for its expected life time/as long as the business requires it.
