title: "Drawbacks of teleworking for employers"
---
increased costs of providing/maintaining computer equipment and   telecommunication links for the teleworkers  

More difficult to manage the teleworkers so unable to e.g. Motivate/guide  
them  

More difficult to monitor the performance of the teleworkers so cannot check   on work rate/targets so easily  

Cannot manage the times/hours of the working environment of teleworkers  
so cannot tell when they are working  

Cannot manage the health/safety aspects of the working environment of  
teleworkers so may be liable for unknown risks  

Increased security risk to the data/information that is used by/sent to/from  
teleworkers so must set up secure links/encryption systems  

Working in different time zones from company/other employees may cause  
difficulties  

Some types of work/tasks are unsuitable for teleworking.
