title: "Evolutionary prototyping compared to Throw-away prototyping "
--- 
User/client may decide that the early version is all that is needed

Developers can focus on developing parts of the system that they
understand

Instead of developing a whole system which might be beyond their
comprehension

Improvements/alterations/add-ons to the system can be created later

First prototype is not discarded so materials/time are not wasted

Throw-away prototypes may not work at all/be on paper only

Can be used in interim until final system is complete.
