title: "3D Printing in medicine "
---
No need to wait for real/native blood vessels to grow into implanted
/repaired tissue

Allows oxygen/O2 to be supplied immediately to implant which is more likely
to survive grow

Vessels can be customised for the individual organ which is more likely to fit
Less likely to be rejected by recipient than real blood vessels. 

## advantage for making medicine 
Chemical components of the drug can be customised at molecular level to
individual patient

Drug can be customised to deal with patient specific issues/ethnic
origin/DNA

A chemical blueprint can be created so that the drug can be printed at any
pharmacy/druggist/drug store

...using specific components/compounds

Drug can be personalised for/targeted to a specific illness/infection


## disadvantage for making medicine

Human errors in use of blueprints/mislabelling can lead to incorrect drug
being created

...incorrect dosage being used

Difficult to validate/verify drug creation so, e.g. incorrect base materials may
be used

Difficult to regulate use of the drug/printing machines across (international)
borders

Difficult to regulate the supply of the drugs once blueprint is
published/available to patient

Bio-safety/hygiene/sanitary/cleanliness of production difficult to control at
home

Could be used/customised to produce illegal drugs


## In Surgery

Re-creation/repair of damaged bone structures by printing customised
structures for use in surgical procedures.

Creation of customised surgical implants to match patient anatomy.

Creation of customised surgical prostheses to aid recovery.

Bioprinting of tissues for use in surgical procedures/recovery.

Creation of customised anatomical models for planning surgery/surgical
preparation.

Creation of customised surgical tools to match patient requirements.

Creation of customised jigs/frames for use in surgical theatres/operating
rooms.
