Benefit of direct changeover:

- Store can change systems when store is shut
- Benefits of new system are available to all users immediately
- Can be carried out (overnight/quickly) with minimal disruption to the store operations

---

- Drawback of direct implementation:

- If the new system fails, the old system is not available for use in store
- May lose data as old data cannot be installed on new system
- Staff have very little time to learn the new system so may make errors/mistakes
