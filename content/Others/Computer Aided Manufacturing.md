## Benefits of CAM:
- High accuracy in large scale production
- Production can be faster than traditional methods
- Can produce complex products easier than traditional methods
- CAD can produce the instructions and send to CAM electronically obviating need for manual programming
- JIT(Just In Time) can be used in conjunction with CAM
- CAM can have higher production rate as it can run continuously without much supervision

## Drawbacks of CAM:
- Can be slow for one off products
- Need a separate CAM machine for each product
- Software is expensive to develop/maintain
- Expensive to train users to use the system
- Errors can affect the whole production. 
- CAM is more expensive than manual machinery so adds to production costs
- CAM programs/CNC can take a long time to produce
