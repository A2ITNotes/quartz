Needed to calculate critical path:

- List of all the activities needed to complete/finish the project
- A breakdown of e.g. resource allocation/work schedules
- Duration of each activity
- Dependencies between activities in the project
- End points of each activity and what can be completed at that point
- Measurable/observable milestones during the project
- Duration of project including float variables.

Outcomes from critical path analysis:

- A visual/graphical representation of the whole project
- Earliest/latest start dates for project tasks
- Longest path/time that will be taken for project
- Expected project end date
- Any near/almost critical paths that may be possible alternatives in project
- The shortest possible time to complete the project.
