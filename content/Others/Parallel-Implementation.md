title: "Parallel Implementation"
---
> Parallel running requires the new system to run/be used alongside the old system for a period of time.
---
 
Benefits of Parallel: 
- Can ensure that the new system is running without errors by comparing results to the existing system
- Can resolve any errors by checking with the old system to find any modifications needed
- If the new system fails then the old system is still operating so there is no loss of data/functions/work
- Staff can be trained on the new system in batches as the old system is still operating/not all new staff need to use the new system at once
- Staff may be more confident in using the new system if they can check against the old system

---

Drawbacks of parallel:
- Costs of running both systems at the same time can be expensive
- Staff may have to use both systems and require extensive training
- Staff may have to do twice the amount of work
- Maintenance and checking can be frequent and time-consuming
- Data has to be duplicated and input twice
- Data has to be carefully checked to ensure that the same data is going into both systems.
