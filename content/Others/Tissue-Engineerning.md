Advantages of tissue engineering: 

- Tissue engineering uses biological materials methods to replace biological structures with a greater success rate in patients.
- Development of substitute materials for tissues has reduced costs.
- Reduces the need for biological donors e.g. use of artificial blood/skin.
- Reduces the recovery times for patients.
- Reduces the risk of tissue rejection.
- Can produce customised tissues for individual patients.
- Development of artificial organs has increased survival ratese.g. use of artificial liver
- Religious objections to using donated organs can be overcome using artificial tissues.
- Production of artificial meat products reduces environmental impact of  animal farming.

Disadvantages of tissue engineering:

- Can be very costly to carry out if sufficient base material is limited so new material must be developed.
- May not be sufficient base material available for development.
- Possible inclusion of hidden diseases in base tissue.
- Latent diseases are difficult to find with current technology.
- Ethical issues are difficult to resolve.
- Can increase the treatment time as tissue can take longer to grow
