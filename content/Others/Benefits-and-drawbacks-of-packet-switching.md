title: "Benefits and drawbacks of packet switching. "
--- 
Benefits of Packet Switching include :  

- Makes very efficient use of the network as communication lines are shared  
- Data packets can be routed around unusable nodes of the   network so if part of network is faulty packets   can still reach destination  
- The network only has to expand slowly with increase in users  compared to circuit switching

Drawbacks of Packet Switching:  

- The packaging of the data changes each time a packet is  switched so there is a latency  
- Can cause a problem for time-critical information such as an   emergency signal/video streaming  
- Small data packages are inefficiently packaged
