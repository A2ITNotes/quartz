Packet Vs Message Vs Circuit Switching:
- Packet switching breaks the message into discrete data packets whereas message and circuit may not do so
- Packet switching can introduce delays as packets may travel via different routes whereas message and circuit switching do not
- Packet and message switching make more efficient use of the capacity of the transmission medium than does circuit switching
- Circuit switching keeps the circuit connected for the whole of the duration of the transmission whereas message and switching do not
- Circuit switching uses the full bandwidth of the transmission medium whereas message and packet switching do not
- Circuit switching can guarantee a higher quality of service compared to the other methods
- Message switching can be less secure because messages are stored (temporarily) at nodes 
- Circuit switching can guarantee a higher level of security of data compared to the other methods
- Others can use the same communication channel when packet switching is used whereas this is not possible when message and circuit switching is used.
