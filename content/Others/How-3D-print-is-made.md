How is 3D print made:

- Computer file contains (standard triangle language (STL)) instructions for creating/printing object.
- File is produced from CAD application/software.
- Software breaks object into layers.
- Creates (3D) solid objects from computer instructions.
- Object is created from liquid/powder material.
- Process is additive/material is added to existing layer by layer.
- Material in layers of binder material and powder/liquid (by inkjet printer).
- Printed object is finished by removing support parts.
- Any oversize printing is removed and finishing is done with fine grinding/polishing.
