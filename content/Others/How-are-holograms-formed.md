title: "How are holograms formed "

How are holograms formed:

- Use of laser lights (from different directions) to form interference patterns.
- Use of object beam and reference (laser) beams/coherent light with one wavelength.
- Object beam is passed through scene onto recording medium.
- Reference beam hits only recording medium.
- Object and reference beams create interference pattern and create image on a recording medium placed where the beams hit.
- Medium and beams must not move.
- Reference beam is used to recreate hologram from pattern on plate by diffraction.
- Holographic images may be copied by photographic techniques.
- Holographic images may be viewed in white light.
