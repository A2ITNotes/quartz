Advantages of QR on products:
- Can be scanned using any smartphone so accessible to users
- QR codes can encode almost all types of data e.g. numeric/binary so flexible
- Scanning occurs very fast so products can be checked out quickly at tills
- QR code has good fault tolerance so even if some part of the code is damaged information can still be decoded
- Stores large amount of information unlike 1D barcodes so provides more details to users
- A QR code takes up less space on the packaging than a large amount of written information on the packaging so there is more room on the packet for images/advertisements.

Disadvantages of QR on products:
- Smart phones used to scan QR codes are expensive compared with simpler phones so not all users have access
- Users are not familiar with its use so may ignore the codes
- Requires training in order to fully understand the use and idea so users have to gain the skills
- Aesthetically poor as it contains random patterns of square boxes which might not look pleasing on products so might deter buyers
- Cannot be updated so need to be reprinted if details change so packaging becomes outdated
- Requires an internet connection to allow access to the additional information so information may not be available.
