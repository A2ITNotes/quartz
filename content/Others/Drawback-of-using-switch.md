title: "Drawback of using switch"
---
- The order of Case checks in code must be logically
correct
- …for correct comparisons to be made
- (Switch) syntax does not follow the usual colons not semi-colons so code is difficult/confusing to write/read
- Code can be lengthy as each condition has to be individually stated
- …this is repetitive and prone to error
- ‘break’ has to be manually inserted after every ‘case’
- ….debugging problems/difficulties with ‘nested’ conditions
- ’default’ condition should be included to catch/trap unexpected conditions.
