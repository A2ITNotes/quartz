title: "3D Printing In Space"
---
- Can create ‘hard-to-build’ objects for space vehicles (e.g. rocket nozzles, antennae)
- Can make designs simpler as no need to take into account the cutting tools
- …objects can be created with less bulk, reducing launch costs
- Used to create replacement parts to order
- Used to create specialist tools/medical instruments when needed
- No need to carry a collection of spare parts so saving weight
- one off objects can be created at low cost so reducing costs of materials and manufacturing, lowering the cost of space vehicles

- Delicate items can be printed in space to avoid stress of launch
