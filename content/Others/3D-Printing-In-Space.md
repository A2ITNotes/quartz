title: "3D Printing In Space"
---
Can create/print/manufacture ‘hard-to-build’ objects/objects with complex
geometry for space vehicles/craft/satellites (e.g. rocket nozzles, antennae)
…saves weight/increases strength/rigidity of objects when printed as one
part
Can make designs simpler as no need to take into account the cutting
tools/design create cutting tools
…objects can be created with less bulk, reducing launch costs
Used to create/print/manufacture replacement parts to order
Used to create/print/manufacture specialist tools/medical instruments when
needed
No need to carry a collection of spare parts/tools so saving weight/space
Low volume/one off objects can be created at low cost so reducing costs of
materials and manufacturing, lowering the cost of space vehicles
Models of new designs for space vehicles/parts can be quickly created
Can create lattice structures instead of solid. These have reduced weight
Delicate items can be printed in space to avoid stress of launch
Items can be created and tested as 3D objects with no joins/welds that
might be unsafe/problematic in space.
