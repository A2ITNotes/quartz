Quantum Cryptography Over Public Wifi:

- Allows use of cryptographic tasks that would be deemed impossible without the use of quantum cryptography,  e.g. the guarantee that any interception of the data is detected

- Calculations can be carried out extremely rapidly so much higher bi-length for keys can be used so increasing security of data when encrypted

- Does not do away with conventional cryptographic keys i.e. a mathematical algorithm is still needed for the actual encryption of the data

- Uses photons to carry data in terms of their ‘spin’ which is difficult to generate consistently filters to determine the spin are difficult to manufacture

- Requires extremely pure fibres to transmit photons intact over anything but short distances – maximum so far is about 60 km/far shorter distance than conventional fibre use can reach

- Requires a new generation of computers to become a viable reality

- In theory, quantum techniques can break any encryption in a usefully short time.
