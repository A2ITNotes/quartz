Reasons for technical documentation

- So that the installer knows what hardware/software is required
- So that any data structures can be amended by (another) programmer
- So that any programmer can understand how the data flows through the system
- System flowcharts so that any programmer knows how the system works
- To provide a basis for technical writers to create user manuals
- To provide a reference for programmer to update the system.
