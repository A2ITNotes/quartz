Bluetooth Headphones Vs Cable:

- Cable ensures an uninterrupted connection to the TV
- Cable does not suffer from dynamic range limitations as does Bluetooth transmission so (action) movies do not have same impact
- Cable does not suffer from limited frequency ranges as does Bluetooth transmission so movie experience can be spoiled
- Cable does not need power in the headphones so can be used without preparation when watching movies 
- Bluetooth can suffer from interference from other wireless devices which can spoil the sound (effects) from movie
- Bluetooth takes time to process so video and audio are out of sync
- Bluetooth headphones can be larger due to battery requirements 
- Bluetooth headphones do not work if battery is flat , so cannot listen to sound of movie.
