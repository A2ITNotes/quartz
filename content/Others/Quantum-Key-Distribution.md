Quantum Key Distribution:
- Initial polarization/ of first two photons determines 0 and 1 bit of the data
- Polarisation of subsequent bits is determined at random
- Recipient measures data using random polarisation until data is as sent
- Used to establish a shared key between sender
- No third party sees the key
- Key then used to create other keys for use in encryption
- Called quantum key distribution (QKD)
