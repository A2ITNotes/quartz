Lossy Vs Lossless compression
- Lossless compression retains data/pixels.
- Lossy removes data/pixels.
- Both compression reduces the file size.
- Lossless compression (usually) results in larger file size than lossy compression.
- Lossless compression avoids compression artefacts when editing images.
- Lossless compression allows editing to be (more easily) reversed whereas lossy does not.
- Lossless compression keeps original uncompressed image appearance whereas lossy can alter (perceived) appearance.
- Lossy compression can use variable compression.
- Saving/storing the file as in a compressed file format/jpeg.
