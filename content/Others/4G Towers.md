4G Towers
- Download speeds are typically 2 to 5 times that of 3G
- Provides bandwidths of up to 100Mps (typically 15 to ) c.f. 3G’s 6 to 10Mps
- Uses OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) / same technology as WiFi and digital TV which reduces latency as data is split and sent in parallel ‘chunks’ to increase capacity
- Uses MIMO (multiple input and multiple output) with multiple antenna arrays at transmitter and receiver to increase performance
- Common configuration is 2×2 MIMO for smartphones
- Reduces power requirements
- Reduces the need for additional bandwidth
- Does not require extra data allowance to be used
- Can revert seamlessly to 3G if 4G is not available
- Provides smoother online streaming than 3G
- Is an IP-based network
