Social Networking:

- Voters can contact others with views to comment upon so increasing their influence on politicians
- Extremist views can spread very easily
- Can (re-)connect with friends very easily
- Can keep up to date with latest news
- Difficult to keep views private
- Can become victim of e.g. cyber-bullying
- Have more ‘friends’
- Become more isolated from family
- Less likely to share personal details in case it is shared widely
- Less trusting of friends in case they share personal details
- Personal details are published leading to vulnerability to identity theft
- Background checks by prospective employers can reveal (embarrassing) social media postings.
