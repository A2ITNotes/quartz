title: "Factors That Affects The accuracy of GPS"
--- 
Atmospheric delays slowing the  
satellite signal slows as it passes through the atmosphere  
  
Signal multipath errors as the GPS signal is reflected off objects  
before it reaches the receiver  
...increases the travel time of the signal  
  
Clock errors in the receiver because the built-in clock is not as  
accurate as the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites  
  
Orbital errors ( ephemeris errors) of the satellite's reported  
location  
  
The number of satellites visible may be too few because  
buildings foliage may block the signal reception  
electronic interference can block the signals  
  
...causing position errors /no position reading  
...GPS units usually will not work indoors, underwater or  
underground  
  
Satellite geometry/shading because the relative position of the  
satellites at any given time is not ideal for signal reception by the  
receiver  
  
...the satellites should be located at wide angles relative to each  
other  
  
...poor geometry occurs when the satellites are located in a  
line/tight grouping  
  
Intentional degradation of the satellite signal by the  
operator/owner of the satellites  
  
...to prevent military adversaries from using the highly accurate  
GPS signals
