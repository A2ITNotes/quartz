title: "Fourth (4th) generation optical data storage systems "
--- 
- Use holographic techniques
- Use of green laser and red laser to record data as holograms
- Green laser reads data from the (interference fringes) of the hologram (near top of disk surface)
- Red laser is the reference beam reading  data from aluminum layer near bottom
- thin film layer is used to prevent interference between the layers
- Uses collinear holography that can be read by a single optical system
- Can store terabytes of data on small disks
- Use polymer as recording medium
- â€¦ thickness of medium can determine recording capacity
- Used in Ultra HD Blu-ray for very high definition video.
