MOOC VS ONLINE TUTORIAL
Contrast:

- MOOC provides interactive user forums whereas online tutorials do not provide these
- MOOC content can be re-interpreted by students leading to loss of control by the instructors whereas online tutorials are fixed in in their aims/objectives.
- MOOC covers more content than a tutorial because tutorials are focussed on one/limited topic(s)
- MOOC are more easily scalable to encompass more content than online tutorials
- Unlike an online course which focuses more on content, MOOCs focus more on context.
- Online courses are closed-ended with static content whereas the content in a MOOC evolves dynamically through learner participation
