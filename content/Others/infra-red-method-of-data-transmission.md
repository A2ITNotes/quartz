Infrared for data transmission:

- Suitable for use in ‘free-space’ i.e. no physical connection medium such as cable or fibre
- Infra-red LEDs allow point-to-point optical commnciations
- Infra-red LEDs allow high data rates using laser technology
- Infra-red LEDs allow relatively inexpensive compared to other radio technologies
- Uses pulsing modulation/on-off signals which can restrict rates to low data rates in free space
- Suitable for short distance communication between devices (usually only maximum of a few metres)
- May not work relaibly when too close together
- Line of sight required so objects block the signals
- Can be more secure than other radio technologies as range is low/easily blocked by objects.
