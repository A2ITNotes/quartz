Audio Bitrate:

- Audio quality improves with increasing bit rate
- ...two examples from:
	- ...800 bit/s is minimum for speech to be recognised
	- 32 kbit/s – generally acceptable only for speech
	- 96 kbit/s – generally used for speech/low-quality streaming
	 -128 or 160 kbit/s – midrange bit rate quality
	 -192 kbit/s – a commonly used high-quality bit rate
	 - 3 kbit/s – highest bitrate level supported by the MP3 standard
- ...lossy compression to reduce bit rate can introduce artefacts
- ...caused by data/quantisation errors
- ...distortion of sound
- ...perceived/heard as ‘bubbling/burbling’
- ...stuttering/jerky in sound.
