Holography In Medicine:
- X-ray holography can be used for imaging internal organs of the body
- No need for invasive surgery
- Used for living biological specimens
- With very high resolution without the need for sample preparation
- Endoscopic holography is used for producing high resolution 3D imaging
- With no non-destructive measurements inside the natural cavities of internal organs
- Ophthalmology use to correct problems with lenses implanted after cataract surgery
- In dentistry to store dental records of tooth prints as training aids for students
- In otology ear studies to study the vibrations of how the inner ear bones move
- In orthopaedics to measure strains on fixation pins/rods
- 3D images of biological specimens can be created from a series of 2D radiological images
- Using holographic stereogram techniques
- Holographic contour generation is useful for measurements of biomedical specimens.
