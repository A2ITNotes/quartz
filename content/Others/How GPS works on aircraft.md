How GPS is used:
- GPS receiver receives signals
- ....from four (4) satellites simultaneously
- Satellites transmit time (of their atomic clock) to GPS receiver which uses times from satellites to calculate current time reset GPS receiver clock
- Satellite and GPS receiversâ€™ times are synchronised
- GPS receiver uses almanac of satellite positions
- Satellites transmit (pseudo random) code at set time
- GPS receiver uses difference in code timing to calculate the time it takes signals to travel from satellite to it
- Error correction techniques allow for atmospheric issues
- Uses 3D trilateration to calculate position and altitude
- GPS receivers overlay calculated positions/latitude and longitude on stored maps to show visual representation of position
- Use of four satellites allows altitude to be calculated and displayed.
