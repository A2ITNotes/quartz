How Satellite Television Work;

- Satellite is in geostationary orbit so appears to be at fixed point above surface of Earth.
- Must be at correct height c.37 000 km above equator.
- Satellite has transponder(s) which receive(s) and transmit(s) signals (to/from Earth).
- Receive and transmit signals use different frequencies.
- Transmit (to Earth) signals are in set range/4–8 and 12–18 GHz range.
- Horizontal and vertical signal polarisation is used to increase capacity.
- Digital TV signal is encoded as standard signal with sound/audio (uplinked from Earth station).
- TV signal may be encrypted to prevent viewing without paying for service.
- High definition signals with multi-channel sound requires more bandwidth.
- Receiving dish on Earth is pointed at the satellite in line of sight.
- Receiver/TV/ decodes signal into pictures and sounds for display on TV.
- May include system for decrypting ‘scrambled’ pay TV signal.
