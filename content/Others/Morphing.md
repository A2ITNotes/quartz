Morphing:

- deforming these from the original images so final image has same  shape  
- «use of forward mapping  
- «each pixel in original image is mapped to an appropriate  
- «pixel in final image  
- «use of reverse mapping  
- «each pixel in the final image is sampled for an usable/ appropriate pixel in   the original  
- «all final image pixels are mapped to an original image pixel  
- Cross-dissolving the images  
- «a sequence of images shows a gradual fade from one to the other  
- «via a (series of) transition images  
- «original image is gradually distorted and faded out  
- «final image starts out totally warped to the first and is faded in

Using the four frames as key frames  
...filling in of frames between frames 1, 2, 3 and 4  
...using variable frame frequency depending on content  
...fewer frames between frames 1 and 2 than e.g. between 2 and 3  
...as background is stationary then lower frame rate than foreground  
characters  
May be low frame rate so makes motion jerky/unrealistic  
Need to add at least 8 frames in order to create smooth movement  
Need to add enough frames so that frame rate is below ‘flicker fusion’  
threshold«  
...else movement will appear to flicker and illusion of movement is destroyed  
Motion blurring of the figures between frames 1 and 2 etc. can simulate faster  
movement.
