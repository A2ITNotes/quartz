VPN Protocols:

- IP security (IPsec) encrypting the data in the packet
- Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol (L2TP) and IPsec where L2TP creates the tunnel while IPsec does the encryption
- Secure Socket Layer/SSL creates handshake system in conjunction with Transport Layer Security/TLS
- Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol/PPTP to create a tunnel and encapsulate the data packet
- An additional protocol will handle the encryption, e.g. TCP Secure Shell (SSH)
- SSH will create the tunnel and carry out the encryption of the tunnel (not the data).
