Torrent VS Direct Download

- If many people want the OS at once bit torrent is resistant to,website overload/dos [DoS-Attack](Others/DoS-Attack.md) 
- FTP is not resistant to website overload/dos  
- Bit torrents can be paused/stopped and restarted  
- FTP cannot restart if paused, so if interrupted the download has to be done again  
- Bit torrent makes many small data requests from different IP connections/addresses  
- FTP is from one IP connection/address so is quicker to download the large OS file  
- Bit torrent downloads file sections randomly/rarest first/ FTP is sequential   download of file sections  
- Bit torrent can be slow to get up to full speed/FTP achieves full speed as soon as it starts download and can achieve very high download speeds
