How Wifi transmission work:

- Uses radio waves in 2.4 GHz/5 Ghz frequency range
- Data frames are modulated onto carrier wave
- Spread spectrum used for higher power levels
- Two channels used for full duplex exchange of data/most WiFi is half-duplex
- WiFi network uses SSID to identify itself
- Access point and device must be connected to same WiFi network/SSID to be able to exchange data
- Data is encrypted for security during transmission 
- Devices must use IEEE 802.11 protocols/standards
- IEEE 802.11 has a number of variants a/b/g/n/ac
- 14 channels on 2.4 GHz which are spaced  apart to reduce channel interference.
