title: "Pros and Cons for bitmap file formats"
--- 
Advantages/disadvantages of different bitmap file formats from:

- JPEG
	- Allows both lossy and lossless compression to be used
	- Widely supported by web browsers
	- Suffers image degradation/artefact when repeatedly edited and saved
	- Requires more processing power than some other formats due to compression techniques
	- Does not (easily) support transparency
	- Does not encode large uniform areas of colour well
---

PNG
	- Free/open source so can be used by anyone without recrimination
	- Supports transparency
	- Works well in web browsers
	- Performs well with large uniform colour areas
	- Works well when progressively downloaded

BMP
	- File sizes can be large
	- Widely acceptable to Microsoft Windows applications
---

GIF
	- Supported by web browsers
	- Supports animation
	- Does not support colour management across different devices so colours may alter
	- Only support up to 256 colours

---

TIFF
	- Can store 24-bit colour by using up to 48 bits per colour
	- Uses lossless compression/LZW compression for no data loss
	- Not widely supported by web browsers
	- File sizes can be large
	- Does not support interlacing
	- Does not support animation.
