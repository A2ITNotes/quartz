Quantum Cryptography :

- Use of polarised light for encoding data
- In quantum states for transmission between two parties
- Data state is changed when viewing by others
- Impossible to eavesdrop on data encoded in quantum state without alerting the sender/recipients. 
- Uses Quantum key distribution
