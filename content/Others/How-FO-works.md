How Fiber Optic works:

- Electrical signals converted to light for transmission / converted back to electrical signals after transmission
- LED / laser (at node) transmits a light beam  along the fibre
- Data is modulated onto a carrier wave
- Optical fibre connects the nodes 
- ADC / DAC are used to modulate / demodulate the data onto / off carrier wave
- Laser is used where longer distances are to be covered
- LED is used where shorter distances are to be covered as it is cheaper than laser
- Lasers produce coherent light which can allow greater bandwidth
- Receiver is photo detector to convert light into electricity
- Uses indium gallium arsenide in photo detector.
