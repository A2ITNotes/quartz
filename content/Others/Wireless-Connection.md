## Benefits of wireless connections:

- Devices are easier to move around as no wires needed...
- ...no need to physically connect
- ...no trailing wires to trip over
- Greater productivity by home-workers as they can carry laptop/device with them while doing other tasks
- Ease of expansion with new devices as single access point required
- ...devices can be added without need to add cables
- ...no need to drill holes for cables
- Less expensive than wired connections so no cost of new hubs/switches/sockets/wires

## Drawbacks of wireless:

- Security issues so encryption required which may be difficult to set up
- Range issues as it is restricted to only 10s of metres from access point
- ....physical objects may interfere with signal
- ....reduced signal strength as distances from access point increases
- Reliability issues
- ...subject to interference from other wireless devices/electrical items
- Speed issues as rate of data transfer is lower than for cabled connections
- ...may vary during a session leading to poor user experience
