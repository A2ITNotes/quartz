title: " Need of data protection law"
--- 
Data protection laws are needed to address these concerns e.g.: 

- Personal data is stored in databases which may not be secure
- Databases are easily edited so data can be seen  manipulated
- Data can be easily cross-referenced by computer systems
- Computer systems can be networked so data can be accessed from many different locations easily between users
- Control over shared data is more difficult to maintain
- Accuracy of the information may be difficult to maintain when shared
- Data can be easily copied to other media without any trace of the action
- Data about individuals can be stored without their knowledge so infringing their privacy
- Keeping records of  when data is accessed are difficult to maintain unless enforced by law.
