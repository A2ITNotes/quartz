Wifi Signal Weakening;

- Other devices can cause interference
	- ...remove other devices e.g. microwave ovens which can interfere with signal
- Ensure that access points do not use same frequencies/channels...
	- ...other access points may use same WiFi channel and interfere with user’s channel
- Restrict use of bluetooth 
	- ...Bluetooth® signals can cause interference
- Restrict use of mobile phones...
	- ...mobile telephone systems can cause interference
- Adjust wireless access point settings
- walls/insulation objects may block WiFi signals so use materials that are transparent to wireless signals
- Restrict use of ‘legacy’ bands for WiFi
	- ...routers are slower if they have to broadcast on several bands simultaneously
- Set access point antennas to optimum position/orientation
	- ...may be set too low/wrong angle/hidden.
