DoS:
- DoS is a Denial of Service attack
- Where a computer is made unavailable by overwhelming the target system with requests for service
- Requests for service have no purpose other than to overload the system
- Can use many IP addresses to carry out a DoS

prevention of DoS Attacks:

- Use of firewall configured to deny incoming packets with IP addresses from identified attackers
- Use of tools to analyse incoming data to identify illegitimate requests
- Use of DNS routing to re-route IP addresses intended for attacker to non-existent IP address/server
- Use of DNS sinkhole to direct traffic to valid IP address for analysis to reject unwanted packets
- Use of a specialised â€˜cleaning servers to separate out unwanted traffic from legitimate traffic
- Defence is at application layer.
