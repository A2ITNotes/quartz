Bandwidth in video conferencing:

- Bandwidth requirements are higher to allow more detail in video images
- Video-conferencing requires higher resolution video because there are often several people on screen at once
- Need to see facial features/body expressions of participants clearly
- One person to another (when video-conferencing) does not require high resolutions
- High bandwidth (of 2â€“4 Mbps) would deliver an (H7p) high definition image for multiple participants
- Low bandwidth (of 512 kbps) would be sufficient for one-to-one videoconferencing
- Low bandwidth does not allow high definition images so would not be able to properly see the faces of multiple participants
- High bandwidth would allow higher frame rates/30fps for smooth motion
- Limited/low bandwidth requires trade-off between resolution and frame rate
- Resolution priority for displaying slideshows/documents in detail
- Motion priority for displaying video presentations.
