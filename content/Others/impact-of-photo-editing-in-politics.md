Image editing in politics:

- Altered images can dissuade reinforce a belief of the viewer
- Adding people to images can persuade the viewer that the person was present when in fact they were not
- Removing people from photographs can create the belief that the person did not participate in an event
- Removing out of favour people from photographs can create the belief that the person did not exist
- Retouching images of politicians can make them appear more attractive than in real life so more likely to appeal to a voter
- Viewers can be unaware that an image has been manipulated so may make decisions based on false information.
