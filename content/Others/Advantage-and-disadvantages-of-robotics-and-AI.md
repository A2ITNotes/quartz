Advantages of AI in robotics:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) in robotics enables closer interaction between robotic and human.
- Robotics used in homes for domestic duties reduce human work.
- Use of AI-robots in medicine to perform surgery so provide more surgeons.
- Use of AI-robots in medicine to perform surgery can speed up surgery
- Use of AI-robots in caring for sick/elderly humans reduces the need for carers.

Disadvantages  of AI in robotics:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) in robotics enables intrusion into of workspace of humans.
- Robotics used in homes for domestic duties enquire power sources leading to increased costs.
- Robots used in homes for domestic duties may not be so thorough as humans.
- Robots have displaced humans from jobs.
- AI-robots consume more power than simple robots.
- AI needs to provide communication skills that humans can interact with.
- Some tasks are more acceptable if AI-robot is humanoid in shape.
- Development of rules/etiquette for AI-driven robots that is acceptable to humans.
- Requires AI and systems for understanding social cues from humans.
