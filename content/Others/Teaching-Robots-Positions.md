Teaching Robots Position:

- Positional commands entered using GUI
- Specify required X-Y-Z positions
- ‘Lead-by-the-nose’ method by one person holding the end-effector and moving to positions...
- ...with recording of motions/positions
- Off-line programming to input the positions as code
- Mapping the positions in graphic format
- Use of a ‘teach pendant’/hand-held control to move end-effectors and program the positions at the same time
- Robot simulation tools used to replicate and the positions/motion
- Record the data for programming real robot.
