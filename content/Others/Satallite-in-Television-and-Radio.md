Drawbacks of satellite TV:

- Requires viewers have (suitable) receiving equipment
	- ...broadcasters may have a limited audience if few people have satellite receivers
	- ...need line of sight view to satellite to be able to receive
	- ...need to be professionally installed which takes time and can be costly
- Satellite technology has a huge setup cost
- Satellites do not have an unlimited lifespan
	- ...may become space junk when lifespan is over
- Repair of orbiting satellites is almost impossible
- Signals to ground can be subject to blockage due to weather
- Significant delays in signal travel time of signals from uplink to receiver can cause anomalies e.g. time differences of several seconds in transmissions.
