QR Code Risk:
- Code may contain URL link  
- Web link followed  
- URL contains a trojan that infects the device  
- Trojan is JavaScript  
	- which contacts servers that transmit malware to device  
- Use cross-site scripting vulnerability on a legitimate website to insert a   malicious QR code in place of code  
	- when a web browser opens the legitimate site, the QR code references  the hacker's site  
- Malicious QR codes can allow unauthorised people to control mobile   phones to access messages/GPS turn on the camera(s)/listen in on phone  conversation
