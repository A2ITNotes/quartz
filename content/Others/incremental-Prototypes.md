title: "incremental Prototypes "
--- 
Advantages of incremental prototypes:
- Each stage is an identifiable milestone to track progress
- Testing is carried out at each incremental stage, allowing faults to be identified before final completion
- Testing is quicker because changes are usually small at each iteration of product
- Client can use new features and review these for any further changes
- Product completion of working versions is faster than other methods of development
- Risks can be managed better since risks are identified and handled during each incremental stage
- Product completion of working versions can cost less than other methods of development

Disadvantages of incremental Prototype:
- Incremental changes may affect functionality of earlier versions in an unexpected manner
- May raise problems at the end because all requirements are not produced in product at start
- Overall cost of many increments can become excessive.
