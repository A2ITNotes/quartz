- Simple sentence structure
- â€¦no jargon/slang
- Consistent format for display of information so user knows where to find/look for information

- Labels should be e.g. capitalised/use a colon to indicate data field
- Compatibility with other input screens so that user does not have to re-enter data
- Information requests should be in a logical order
- Information requests should not be repeated.
