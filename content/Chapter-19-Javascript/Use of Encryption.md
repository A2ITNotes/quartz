Uses Of Encryption:

- Encryption protects information by scrambling it using an algorithm with an encryption key to create data
- Data cannot be understood without the key
- (Asymmetric encryption) uses public keys which can be accessed by anyone so no need to send key to specific user
- Private key is known only to recipient so no risk of key interception by unauthorised persons
- Protects data transferred over the internet between web browser and servers reducing possibility of financial data being stolen
- Secures email messages to prevent confidential data being read by unauthorised persons
- Protects cloud storage from outside attacks to prevent confidential data being read by unauthorised persons
- Prevents the theft of data on USB and external drives
- Used in VPNs for secure data transfer across public networks
- Prevents use of stolen passwords to protect personal data from use in e.g. identity theft.
