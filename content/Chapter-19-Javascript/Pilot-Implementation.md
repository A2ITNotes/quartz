title: "Pilot Implementation"
--- 
WiFi internet access for guests in a chain of hotels:

- Running in one hotel until it is working perfectly
- When working perfectly it can be installed in the other hotels
- The method is more effective than installing in all hotels and discovering problems
- If it does not work only one hotel is affected not the whole chain of hotels
- Staff at the hotel can be used to train staff at the other hotels
- Feedback is collected and collating reviews by guests/users in one hotel
- Will take longer to fully implement all guest access to Wi-Fi in all hotels compared to  direct
