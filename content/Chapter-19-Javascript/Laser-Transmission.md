Advantage of laser transmission:

- Between spacecraft (in orbit through vacuum)
- To connect sites across roads 
- Provide (temporary) network connection in e.g. disaster areas where cabling is not possible.

Disadvantage of Laser Transmission

- Short range only in atmosphere due to dispersion of (light) beam by particles in atmosphere
- Accurate aiming of (light) beam may be more difficult
- Difficultly in connection is increased if sender / receiver are moving
- require line of sight.
