Benefits of black box testing:  
- Easy to use as testers do not need to know the inner workings of product  
- ...tester need not know programming languages  
- ...can work through application as would a user  
- Test case can be developed quicker than for white box testing  
- ...testers need only look at GUI  
- ...do not need to discover all the internal paths  
- ....tests are done from point of view of a user  
- ...can expose discrepancies in specification  
- Tests can be conducted by independent personnel from the developers   allowing for an objective perspective  
- ....ensures the avoidance of developer-bias  
- Test cases can be designed as soon as specification are complete

Drawbacks of black box:  

- Test cases will be difficult to design as there is no clear test specification  
- Script maintenance may be difficult  
- ...if the user interface is changing during development  
- Scripts may not work when testing  
- ....GUI may not be the same for different tests  
- ....GUI rendering may change during development  
- Does not test all internal pathways through software  
...does not fully test the software  
- ...many program paths will be left untested.
