Photo-realism:
bitmaps are comprised of small pixels so the bitmap is the most suitable format for photorealistic images or images with high amounts of fine detail vector image, does not because it is comprised of larger objects and cannot achieve fine detail Scalability:
vector images are mathematically defined objects so sizes can be easily manipulated no loss in the quality of the image.</description></item><item><title> Components of an online store</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Components-of-an-online-store/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Components-of-an-online-store/</guid><description>Components of online store:

A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.

Morphing changes one object into a completely different object. Changes by morphing are smooth Morphing (often) overlays grid on image and uses it to remap new image over old, whereas tweening uses location points.</description></item><item><title> 💳 Processing in chip and Pin reader</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Processing-of-chip-and-Pin-reader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Processing-of-chip-and-Pin-reader/</guid><description>How does pin and chip readers work:

Lossless compression retains data/pixels. Lossy removes data/pixels. Both compression reduces the file size. Lossless compression (usually) results in larger file size than lossy compression. Lossless compression avoids compression artefacts when editing images. Lossless compression allows editing to be (more easily) reversed whereas lossy does not. Lossless compression keeps original uncompressed image appearance whereas lossy can alter (perceived) appearance. Lossy compression can use variable compression.

What Is DOM:
Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document.</description></item><item><title>DoS Attack</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/DoS-Attack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/DoS-Attack/</guid><description>DoS:

Throw-away prototypes may not work at all/be on paper only

Computer file contains (standard triangle language (STL)) instructions for creating/printing object. File is produced from CAD application/software. Software breaks object into layers. Creates (3D) solid objects from computer instructions. Object is created from liquid/powder material. Process is additive/material is added to existing layer by layer. Material in layers of binder material and powder/liquid (by inkjet printer). Printed object is finished by removing support parts. Any oversize printing is removed and finishing is done with fine grinding/polishing.</description></item><item><title>how a bitmap (‘raster’) graphic is stored in a computer file</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/how-a-bitmap-raster-graphic-is-stored-in-a-computer-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/how-a-bitmap-raster-graphic-is-stored-in-a-computer-file/</guid><description>How is bitmap stored :

Use of laser lights (from different directions) to form interference patterns. Use of object beam and reference (laser) beams/coherent light with one wavelength. Object beam is passed through scene onto recording medium. Reference beam hits only recording medium. Object and reference beams create interference pattern and create image on a recording medium placed where the beams hit. Medium and beams must not move. Reference beam is used to recreate hologram from pattern on plate by diffraction.</description></item><item><title>How data transfer on wifi works</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/How-data-transfer-on-wifi-works/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/How-data-transfer-on-wifi-works/</guid><description>How Wifi transmission work:

Data state is changed when viewing by others
Impossible to eavesdrop on data encoded in quantum state without alerting the sender/recipients.

Allows use of cryptographic tasks that would be deemed impossible without the use of quantum cryptography, e.g. the guarantee that any interception of the data is detected
Calculations can be carried out extremely rapidly so much higher bi-length for keys can be used so increasing security of data when encrypted
Does not do away with conventional cryptographic keys i.e. a mathematical algorithm is still needed for the actual encryption of the data</description></item><item><title>Quantum Key Distribution</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Quantum-Key-Distribution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Quantum-Key-Distribution/</guid><description>Quantum Key Distribution:

Reduces the need for biological donors e.g. use of artificial blood/skin. Reduces the recovery times for patients. Reduces the risk of tissue rejection. Can produce customised tissues for individual patients.

Satellite is in geostationary orbit so appears to be at fixed point above surface of Earth. Must be at correct height c.37 000 km above equator. Satellite has transponder(s) which receive(s) and transmit(s) signals (to/from Earth). Receive and transmit signals use different frequencies. Transmit (to Earth) signals are in set range/4–8 and 12–18 GHz range. Horizontal and vertical signal polarisation is used to increase capacity. Digital TV signal is encoded as standard signal with sound/audio (uplinked from Earth station).</description></item><item><title>🤖 Robotics</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Robotics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Robotics/</guid><description> Others/Robotic-And-Environment Others/Teaching-Robots-Positions Others/Define-Robotics Advantage-and-disadvantages-of-robotics-and-AI Others/Robotics-in-Space-Exploration Others/robotics-in-the-delivery-of-goods</description></item><item><title>🤖 Robotics in Space Exploration</title><link>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Robotics-in-Space-Exploration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a2itnotes.github.io/Others/Robotics-in-Space-Exploration/</guid><description>Robotics In Space Exploration:
